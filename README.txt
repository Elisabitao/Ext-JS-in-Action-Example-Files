** ABOUT THE PHP FILES FOR CHAPTERS 1 - 15 **

The PHP files included with this zip file are only attached as *examples* of how things can be done.  They use
database helpers from my online instance of Wordpress, thus *WILL NOT RUN* on your local system.  In order to view
examples such as examples that use TreePanels, implement custom Ext.Ajax.request and FormPanel.getForm().submit(),
you will need to view the example online via http://extjsinaction.com/examples .
